# Pizza Sales Data Analysis Project

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of pizza sales data, providing insights into various aspects of the business, from revenue trends to popular pizza types and peak order times. The project leverages SQL for data extraction and manipulation, Excel for initial data processing, and a dashboarding tool (likely Power BI based on the image) for visualization.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project was to analyze historical pizza sales data to identify key performance indicators (KPIs), understand sales patterns, and provide actionable recommendations for business optimization. The analysis covers:

*   **Total Revenue, Orders, and Pizzas Sold:** Quantifying overall business performance.
*   **Average Order Value and Pizzas Per Order:** Understanding customer purchasing habits.
*   **Daily and Hourly Trends:** Identifying peak operational hours and days.
*   **Sales by Category and Size:** Pinpointing top-performing categories and sizes.
*   **Best and Worst Sellers:** Highlighting popular and less popular pizza types.

## Technologies Used

*   **SQL:** For querying and extracting data from the database.
*   **Microsoft Excel:** For data cleaning, transformation, and initial analysis.
*   **Dashboarding Tool (e.g., Power BI/Tableau):** For creating interactive and insightful visualizations.

## Key Findings (from Dashboard)

*   **Total Revenue:** $8,17,860
*   **Average Order Value:** $38.31
*   **Total Pizzas Sold:** 49,574
*   **Total Orders:** 21,350
*   **Average Pizzas Per Order:** 2.32

*   **Busiest Days:** Orders are highest on weekends, particularly Friday/Saturday evenings.
*   **Busiest Times:** Maximum orders occur from 12-1 PM and after 5-8 PM.
*   **Top Categories:** Classical category contributes to maximum sales and total orders.
*   **Top Size:** Large size pizzas contribute to maximum sales.
*   **Best Sellers:** Classic Deluxe & Chicken pizzas are top revenue generators.
*   **Worst Seller:** The Brie Carre pizza is at the bottom in both orders and revenue.
